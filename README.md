# Isolation-Protocol
These are the C# scripts i worked on in Isolation Protocol
They include several areas of the game but I mainly worked on the game systems and tools, such as the procedural level generation and save system, player abilities (shooting and weapons not included) and the hazard and traps scatered through the rooms.
